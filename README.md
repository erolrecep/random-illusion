## Sample Output

## Instructions

You only need numpy and opencv to be installed on your local python environment before running the code.


## Inspiration

I've seen on many tv shows (Person of Interest and The Blacklist) and animations such as "Conway's Game of Life". May be, I will create an animation for Conway's Game of Life and add here later.
